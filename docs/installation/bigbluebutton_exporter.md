# Installation of BigBlueButton Exporter

Two installation methods are supported:

* Docker (recommended)
* Systemd (not recommended)

We recommend Docker because it is easier to update, reproduce builds and comes with all dependencies pre-installed.

## Docker Installation (Recommended)
These instructions will guide you through the installation procedure for BigBlueButton Exporter on your BigBlueButton server 
and direct the HTTP basic auth protected endpoint `/metrics/` to expose your BigBlueButtons server's metrics.
We assume you have a working installation of BigBlueButton with Nginx as the reverse proxy already set up.

!!! Info
    HTTP Basic Auth is required because each request to the `/metrics/` endpoint performs an API call to BigBlueButton 
    which takes a couple of seconds. 
    
Prerequisite:

* Prometheus
* Docker
* docker-compose
* Working BigBlueButton server

### 1. Create directory
```shell
mkdir ~/bbb-exporter
```

### 2. Create docker-compose file
Copy [extras/docker-compose.exporter.yaml](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/tree/master/extras/docker-compose.exporter.yaml) 
to your BigBlueButton server into `~/bbb-exporter/docker-compose.yaml`.
Make sure to replace the Docker image tag to the [latest release](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/releases).

!!! Note
    We assume you will be running the exporter on the BigBlueButton server where you have access to the recordings
    directory (`/var/bigbluebutton`).
    We need access to this directory so we can efficiently compute the metrics for recordings.
    
    You can still run the exporter on a different host by disabling the optimization but will lose certain metrics 
    and increase scrape times. 
    
    See [details regarding the optimization](/exporter-user-guide/#optimizations). 

!!! tip
    Docker best practice: pin your docker image to a specific tag to have a reproducible environment.
    This also makes it easier to check which version you are running and which is the latest release.

### 3. Create secrets file
Take a note of your BigBlueButton's API base url and secret by running:
```shell
bbb-conf --secret
```

Then create the file `~/bbb-exporter/secrets.env` and fill out the `API_BASE_URL` and `API_SECRET` variables with your details.
```text
API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/bigbluebutton/api/
API_SECRET=<secret>
```

!!! warning
    The API base url ends with `/api/` (beware of the trailing slash!). `bbb-conf --secret` will return the base url but
    not the base API url which has a `/api/` appended.

### 4. Start the container
```shell
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The exporter should be running now.
However you will not be able to access it externally because the docker-compose file binded the exporters port only to localhost.
This is because we will use Nginx to act as a TLS termination proxy (reverse proxy with HTTPS support)  

### 5. Create HTTP basic auth password

!!! info
    For this you will need the handy `apache2-utils` package to create a password that will be used with HTTP basic auth by Nginx.
    You can install it (on Ubuntu) by running: `sudo apt-get install apache2-utils`.

Create a username (e.g. metrics) and password.
You will be prompted after you run the `htpasswd` command for the desired password.
```shell
# You may replace metrics with any desired username
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd metrics
```

!!! Warning
    If you already have `/etc/nginx/.htpasswd` file then do not add the `-c` flag, otherwise you will overwrite the file.

### 6. Add Nginx site configuration
Add the location directive to your Nginx web server (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton`) that will proxy traffic to
`127.0.0.1:9688`.

```text
# BigBlueButton Exporter (metrics)
location /metrics/ {
    auth_basic "BigBlueButton Exporter";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9688/;
    include proxy_params;

}
```

!!! Tip
    When upgrading BigBlueButton (using the script), the upgrade procedure will overwrite the contents of `/etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton`
    thereby causing you to lose access to your metrics. 
    So after the upgrade you will need to add the location directive again.
    
    You could also add a seperate site configuration, but this will require you to point another domain to the server,
    configure virtual hosting and acquire a seperate HTTPS certificate.

### 7. Reload Nginx and test
First check if your Nginx configuration is syntactically valid:
```shell
sudo nginx -t
```

If everything is okay reload Nginx:
```shell
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now you can try accessing the metrics on `/metrics` and typing in your username/password that you choose in 
[5. Create HTTP basic auth password](#5-create-http-basic-auth-password)

You should get the raw metrics in the Prometheus format.

### 8. Add the exporter to your Prometheus configuration
Now all that is left is to point your Prometheus to the exporter.

In your `prometheus.yaml` configuration add a new job specifying the target (url of the exporter) and HTTP basic auth
credentials.
Replace `example.com` with your BigBlueButton's domain.
```text
- job_name: 'bbb'
  scrape_interval: 5s
  scheme: https
  basic_auth:
    username: "<HTTP BASIC AUTH USERNAME>"
    password: "<HTTP BASIC AUTH PASSWORD>"
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['example.com']
```

!!! Tip
    You can scrape multiple exporters using a single job rule if they all have the same HTTP basic auth username/password <which auth are we talking about?>.

### Updates
To update your BigBlueButton exporter all you have to do is change the docker image tag to the latest release 
(see [releases](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/releases) or 
[Docker image tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/tags)) 
in `~/bbb-exporter/docker-compose.yaml` and re-create the docker container by running:

```shell
cd ~/bbb-exporter
docker-compose up -d
```

Since the container doesn't store anything it is safe to destroy the container.

We recommend you "watch" on GitHub the [projects repository](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/) to be notified
on new releases.
This way you will be always notified when a new update for BigBlueButton Exporter is available.

## Systemd Installation (Not recommended)
This is an alternative installation guide that does not require docker and installs the exporter as a Systemd unit.

After the guide you will have:

* BigBlueButton Exporter installed system wide and you will be able to use systemctl to
start/stop/restart the exporter
* Nginx as a TLS termination proxy for the exporter

Installation should be on the BigBlueButton server, although it is possible to install it on a secondary machine, but 
this will require you to install Nginx and set it up by yourself.

### 1. Install Python 3 pip
```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### 2. Download the source code and install dependencies
```shell
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter.git
cd bigbluebutton-exporter/
# It is recommended to checkout a release tag instead of using the master branch.
# We recommend selecting the latest release tag from:
# https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/releases
sudo git checkout <RELEASE TAG>
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # will install the Python dependencies system-wide
```

### 3. Create a non-privileged user for the exporter
```shell
sudo useradd -r -d /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter -s /usr/sbin/nologin bbb-exporter
sudo chown -R bbb-exporter:bbb-exporter /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter
```

### 4. Copy Systemd unit service and example settings
```shell
sudo cp /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter/extras/systemd/bigbluebutton-exporter.service /lib/systemd/system/
sudo mkdir /etc/bigbluebutton-exporter
sudo cp /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter/extras/systemd/bigbluebutton-exporter/* /etc/bigbluebutton-exporter
```

### 5. Edit settings and replace `API_BASE_URL` and `API_SECRET`
```shell
sudo nano /etc/bigbluebutton-exporter/settings.env 
# or using Vim
sudo vim /etc/bigbluebutton-exporter/settings.env 
```

### 6. Start the bigbluebutton-exporter service
```shell
sudo systemctl start bigbluebutton-exporter
# optional - enable exporter to autostart when booting host
sudo systemctl enable bigbluebutton-exporter
```

### 7. Setup Nginx as a TLS termination proxy
Follow [steps 5 - 7](#5-create-http-basic-auth-password) from the Docker installation instructions.

### 8. Configure Prometheus
Follow [step 8](#8-add-the-exporter-to-your-prometheus-configuration) from the Docker installation instructions.

### Updates
To update the exporter all you need to do is issue a:
```shell
cd /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter
sudo git pull
sudo git checkout <RELEASE TAG>
sudo chown -R bbb-exporter:bbb-exporter /opt/bigbluebutton-exporter
sudo systemctl restart bigbluebutton-exporter
```

Check the [repository releases](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/releases) to get the latest tag.
It is recommended to watch the repository to be alerted when there is a new release available.

## Notes
### Multiple BigBlueButton Servers
You will need to install BigBlueButton Exporter on each server and then just add the server's domain to your
Prometheus `bbb` job target list.

<example>
     static_configs:
  - targets: ['example1.com'], ['example2.com'], ['example3.com']
    
    or 
    
static_configs:
  - targets: ['example1.com']
  - targets: ['example2.com']
  - targets: ['example3.com']
